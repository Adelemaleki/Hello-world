# Hello-world
This is hello world in C++
To start I went to the Zynq server and then in Adele directory
There I did:  git clone https://github.com/Adelemaleki/Hello-world
With this command the repository is created in the Adele file
So there is a just .git and readme.md file there
Then I have create a new file with the name of Hello.cpp and wrote a simple code there
In the next step: cd  Hello-world/
And then to see the status of my repository :git status
it shows the hello.cpp with red color
then if I want to hace the new file and changes to the web github I should do these:
git add Hello.cpp 
git status //its hello.cpp is green now
git commit -m "I added hello world cout" // for commiting you should write a short sentences about changes
git push 
Then it asks for the user and pass of you github web account
Then refresg the web repository you will see your files
